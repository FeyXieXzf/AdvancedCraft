Advancedcraft allows you to give your players more advanced ways of playing Minecraft. Little tweaks that make life so much funnier in the block world of yours.

All the different features are toggleable from **config.yml** file, so if you don't want some of the features in your server, just **disable it!**


## GET IT NOW!
You can get the plugin straight from [Spigot's website](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/⛏-advancedcraft-⛏-1-18-layered-stone-fast-smelt-xp-storage-and-more-⛏.99235/) where the latest versions are.

## Layered Stone
With "layered stone" you can make it so that the stone blocks turn into cobblestone when mined and the same goes with deepslate. You can also apply this to ores. All the different settings can be set in config.yml

## Hand smelting
Who has time to craft a furnace and well even if we might have time, we might not have the needed items to make one when we really wanna smelt our ores?

No worries, now you can just simply hold any fuel of your choice (changeable in **config.yml**) in your off-hand and have the raw ore in your main hand. Then just right-click **BOOM!** you have smelted the raw ore into ingot!
*Works with iron, gold, and copper. Fuel can be self-assigned in config.yml*
## XP storage
There is no real way of "storing" XP in the vanilla Minecraft, well now there is. Simply hold an empty bottle in your hand, sneak and right-click. **TADA**, you have created an experience bottle.

## Zombie infections
Why not add some challenge into the game, and make more zombies! *Special zombies. *Now if Zombie kills a player, a new zombie will spawn with the player's head to haunt other players.

## Slime scooping
Getting slime balls OR magma cream can be hefty job sometimes, well why not allow players to "scoop" them, by attacking Slime or Magma cube with **any shovel** there is a chance it drops some extra slime balls/magma cubes.

## Permissions (optional)
If you want to restrict some of the features to only a certain group of people, you can enable "use-permissions" in **config.yml**. This makes it that the players need specific permissions to for example smelt with hands.

## What next?
I have many different ideas in my mind, how we can expand the plugin to bring even more advanced mechanics to Minecraft, and these will be added in future updates.

If you have something in your mind that needs to be added to the plugin or you found a bug somehow, you can report it and have a discussion on my support server on Discord (**[Feline Development]('https://discord.gg/46x3XN3zDF')**).
